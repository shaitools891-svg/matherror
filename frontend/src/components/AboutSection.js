            I am Shakib, a student of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).

            The primary purpose behind creating this website is to consolidate all free PDF resources 
            and important class links in one place. Often, these resources are difficult to find or 
            get accidentally deleted. It was to solve this problem that I decided to store everything 
            in a central locationâ€”this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website is named after one of my WhatsApp groups. There are plans to add more features 
            in the future. As it is a static website, I am somewhat uncertain about how far I can take it, 
            but I intend to keep trying, Insha'Allah.
